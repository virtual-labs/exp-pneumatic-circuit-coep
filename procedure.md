3) Click on check configuration. If it is correct the next level button is activated. Clcik on Next level button.  \
4) On the left side you will see the library of components required to build the diagram and on the right side you will see the Workspace. \
5) Point the mouse cursor to any component in library you will see the name of component. \
6) Simply left click mouse button on component and drag it to the workspace. \
7) Click on identify button if your identification will be wrong for 8 times then it will prompt a new button as identify hint for components. \
8) After successful identification you need to connect the components with given ports with respective components. \
9) Point mouse cursor to respective component circle it will become bold then select that circle and drag and drop to the respective component circle. \ 
10) Click on check connection button if your connection will be wrong for 8 times then it will prompt a new button as conection hint for components. \ 
11) After successful connection click next level button which will appear. \
